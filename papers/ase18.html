        <h5>Abstract</h5>
        <p>
            Software is often built by integrating components created by
            different teams or even different organizations. With little
            understanding of changes in dependent components, it is challenging
            to maintain correctness and robustness of the entire system. In
            this paper, we investigate the effect of component changes on the
            behavior of their clients. We observe that changes in a component
            are often irrelevant to a particular client and thus can be adopted
            without any delays or negative effects. Following this observation,
            we formulate the notion of <i>client-specific equivalence
            checking</i> (CSE) and develop an automated technique optimized for
            checking such equivalence. We evaluate our technique on a set of
            benchmarks, including those from the existing literature on
            equivalence checking, and show its applicability and effectiveness.
